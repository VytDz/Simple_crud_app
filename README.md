# Simple crud app

Simple crud aplication mvp. Fulfills minimal requirements.
Still needs to be properly typed, calendar library needs some tweaks for time selection, maybe popups to display available/taken times.
Implemented a global state in case I'll expand the app. And BE has more endpoints than FE currently use (also for the same reason).
BE and FE currently kept in separate folders ( there's a plan to finish a react FE aswell).
